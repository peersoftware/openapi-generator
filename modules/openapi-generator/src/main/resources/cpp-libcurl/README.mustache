### Build on Windows with Visual Studio (VS2017)

- Right click on folder containing source code
- Select 'Open in visual studio'

- Select CMake > Build All.

*Note: If the CMake menu item doesn't show up in Visual Studio, CMake
for Visual Studio must be installed. In this case, open the 'Visual Studio
Installer' application. Select 'modify' Visual Studio 2017. Make sure
'Desktop Development with C++' is installed, and specifically that 'Visual
C++ tools for CMake' is selected in the 'Installation Details' section.

Also be sure to review the CMakeLists.txt file. Edits are likely required.*
